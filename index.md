1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter? \
**The most interesting topic is the different factors that can affect/cause wildfires. One big factor is the weather, including windspeed, temperature, and humidity, which is why SDG&E have their own meteorology team and weather stations that help collect these data. Then the data science team can analyze them and predict when is a public safety power shutdown (PSPS) necessary in order to prevent falling electricity poles, which can start fires if fallen into dry grass.**
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.\
**For Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate more on the correlation between each factor and their (individual and combined) likelihood in causing a wildfire. For example, I think that temperature is the biggest reason, and perhaps I would like to run some simulations as well to test my hypothesis.**
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?\
**Currently I have been running most codes locally because most codes take a minute to process at most. However when rendering maps, it takes more than a few minutes, so I'd like to practice more with analyzing my data in batches or change how I validate my results, and maybe using packages like prefect that lets you run tasks in parallel or using DSMLP GPU.**
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?\
**In our current project we have been using a lot of geospatial analysis as well as probability models. I'm interested in continuing to make more geospatial graphs, particularly interactive ones like maps with dashboards that can reflect new data more quickly.**
